# This Python script provides a comprehensive analysis of simulated Google Ads performance data.
# It covers various aspects including:
# - Data Simulation: Generates realistic-looking data at Campaign, Ad Group, Keyword, and Demographic levels.
# - Metric Calculation: Computes key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CTR, CPC, Conversion Rate, CPA, and ROAS.
# - Performance Aggregation: Aggregates data daily, by campaign, ad group, keyword, and demographic segments (Age, Gender, Location).
# - Time-Series Analysis: Calculates period-over-period changes (e.g., Week-over-Week).
# - Anomaly Detection: Implements a Z-score based method to identify significant performance deviations.
# - Budget Pacing Simulation: Provides a basic model to track simulated budget consumption.
# - Optimization Insights: Generates simulated recommendations based on performance rules and demographic analysis.
# - Data Visualization: Creates and saves various plots (line charts for trends, bar charts for comparisons)
#   to visually represent performance across different dimensions.
# - XLSX Export: Exports the raw simulated data and all aggregated reports into a multi-sheet Excel file,
#   suitable for sharing or further analysis.
# This project demonstrates strong Python skills in data manipulation (pandas), statistical analysis (numpy, scipy),
# data visualization (matplotlib, seaborn), and structured reporting, making it ideal for showcasing capabilities
# in digital marketing analytics.
